# VBA-challenge

Hi, I am Xenia :)

These are results and codes I uploaded:

1) There are three screenshots which includes the results of 2018, 2019 and 2020
2) I have two vbs files. Each has two subroutines. The first file is challenge2.vbs, which has the functions stock_function and greatest_function. The stock_function is the main part of the homework that gets the results for the current sheet.

3) The greatest_function inside of challenge2.vbs is part of the bonus credit. After the stock_function is run, then the greatest_function can be run to get the greatest percent increase and decrease. It also shows the greatest total volume to complete the bonus.

4) the file three year func.vbs has the exact same functions as challenge2.vbs, but it performs the actions on the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. This is to finish the bonus credit completely. Just like the single-year functions, the stock_three_function subroutine needs to be run first, and Greatest_function_three needs to be run second for the code to work.

Thank you so much!
